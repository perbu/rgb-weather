# RGB Weather.

This is an experiment to create a weather display using RGB LEDs, either a strip or a matrix. The idea is to 
have a display that can be seen from a distance and that can be updated with the current weather conditions.

It fetches the current weather from yr.no.

It should be able to run on a Raspberry Pi or an MCU, like the RP2040, compiled with TinyGo. Some changes will be needed.
